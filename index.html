            Exploring the persistency of variables that are defined in a module,
            outside of any of its functions. When the module is imported, the
            variable is initialised and then keeps that value, until the module is
            eventually re-imported. This means that the module keeps the information
            stored in the variable even if the variable is not exported. - And this
            is basically what ChatGPT said.

            What I can tell from this example, though, is that the a variable that is
            global to a module is actually global to the whole project! It's not that
            "the module holds the value of the variable for me, until the next
            import"; it's rather that the value is global, hence survives imports of
            functions from the module and function (imported from the module) calls.
